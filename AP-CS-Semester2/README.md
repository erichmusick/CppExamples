C++ Code Examples from High School, Part 2
===========
This solution contains the labs from my second semester of AP Computer Science I took way back in high school. None of the source here quite exactly matches the original.
I've modified the code to use "modern" (STL/Windows) libraries and APIs rather than outdated (conio.h) or libraries from the AP crew (e.g. apvector, apmatrix).

The Format
===========
Within each project, you'll see a Main.cpp that contains the code for the assignment. My teacher emphasized documentation, so there should be sufficient information to 
give you a feel for what's going on. Additionally, at the end of the file, you'll see the sample output ... preserved from the turn of the millennium.

Running the code
===========
1. Open up the solution in Visual Studio (I used Visual Studio Express 2013).
2. Right-click the project you want to run, and choose the "Set as StartUp Project" menu option
3. Press Ctrl + F5 to run without debugging.
