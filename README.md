C++ Code Examples from High School
===========
This is a collection of the labs from the AP Computer Science class I took way back in high school. As such, some of them, especially the first few, are rather rudimentary. 
My goal here isn't to demonstrate some awesome skill or ability of my own but rather preserve this bit of history from my early CS days. In fact, any of the questions I whiteboarded
while interviewing at Microsoft or Google were more complex than most, if not all of, these examples here. More than anything, moving this content to GitHub has been for me an exercise in learning Git, 
cleaning up old content from my web site, and messing around with a little C++. (I work in C# at work.)
