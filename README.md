C++ Code Examples from High School
===========

This solution contains the labs from my first semester of AP Computer Science I took way back in high school. As such, some of them, especially the first few, are rather rudimentary. 
My goal here isn't to demonstrate some awesome skill or ability of my own but rather preserve this bit of history from my early CS days. In fact, any of the questions I whiteboarded
while interviewing at Microsoft or Google were more complex than these examples here. More than anything, moving this content to GitHub has been for me an exercise in learning Git, 
cleaning up old content from my web site, and messing around with a little C++. (I work in C# at work.) 

None of the source here quite exactly matches the original. I've modified the code to use "modern" (STL/Windows) libraries and APIs rather than outdated (conio.h) or libraries from the AP crew (e.g. apvector, apmatrix).

The Format
===========
Within each project, you'll see a Main.cpp that contains the code for the assignment. My teacher emphasized documentation, so there should be sufficient information to 
give you a feel for what's going on. Additionally, at the end of the file, you'll see the sample output ... preserved from the turn of the millenium.

Running the code
===========
Open up the solution in Visual Studio (I used VS Express 2013).
Right-click the project you want to run, and choose the "Set as StartUp Project" menu option
Press Ctrl + F5 to run without debugging.
